      <h2>Napoleon was of average height for his time</h2>
      <p>
        The idea that Napoleon Bonaparte was unusually short is a myth. He was
        recorded as being around 5 feet 2 inches tall in French measurements,
        which translates to about 5 feet 6 inches in modern terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was average for a man in the early 19th century. The misconception
        likely arose from a mix-up between French and British measurement
        systems, as well as British propaganda that sought to portray him as a
        diminutive figure to undermine his reputation.
